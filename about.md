## Evictions on Chicago Public School Students

Amber Avila

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My goal still the same as in the proposal. I will like to look at the impact of housing instability on student performance.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
I am not facing data challanges. I did at dirst have a hard time gathering information on the areas and how it would be needed in my CPS datasets but that was resolved and can be seen in my data now. I think there are factors I would like to include that I do not have. For example, in one of my graphs I am looking at SAT scores but I would love to look at AP placement. I also possible do want to look at the age ranges of those who are getting evicted if that can help with telling a better story.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
I think an article because I would like to discuss the work I did over the summer and how it lead to me to look at this topic.
