Examining the Impact of Housing Instability on Student Performance in Chicago for the School Year 2017-2018
Amber Avila 

This project analyzes the impact of housing instability, specifically eviction rates, on student performance in Chicago during the 2017-2018 school year. By examining eviction rates across Chicago neighborhoods and correlating these with student metrics such as attendance, mobility, and dropout rates, the project seeks to uncover the ways housing instability may disrupt educational outcomes. The findings highlight patterns of eviction concentration in specific areas, the challenges posed by high mobility rates, and the importance of targeted policy interventions for housing stability to support studentsâ€™ engagement and success in school.
